				<strong>"'I am glad that you are here with me,' said Frodo.
				'Here at the end of all things, Sam.'
 'Yes, I am with you, Master,' said Sam, laying Frodo's wounded hand gently to his
breast. 'And you're with me. And the journey's finished. But after coming all that way
I don't want to give up yet. It's not like me, somehow, if you understand.'
 'Maybe not, Sam,' said Frodo, 'but it's like things are in the world. Hopes fail. An
end comes. We have only a little time to wait now. We are lost in ruin and downfall,
and there is no escape.'" </strong> - Lord of the Rings: Return of the King
