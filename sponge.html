	<p>There's a place I'd like to go Somewhere out west<br>
		It's not specific, And the pictures show it best<br>
		I know there's trees, I know there's sand, And I know there's grass<br>
		I know it's somewhere in the past<br>
		There's a girl out there who's lookin for it too<br>
		She's not sure when she'll go Or exactly what she'll do<br>
		If I am doomed am I the first one or the last?<br>
		Am I just someone from the past?</p>
