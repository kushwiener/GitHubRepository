	<p>There's a place I'd like to go
Somewhere out west
It's not specific
And the pictures show it best

I know there's trees
I know there's sand
And I know there's grass
I know it's somewhere in the past

There's a girl out there who's lookin for it too
She's not sure when she'll go
Or exactly what she'll do
If I am doomed am I the first one or the last?
Am I just someone from the past?</p>
